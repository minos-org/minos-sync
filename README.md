## About

Tipical minos packages are created through [launchpad recipes](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/SourceBuilds) who fetch and mix 2 git/bzr/svn repositories:

    project
    project-deb

Only a handful of these repositories are maintained actively at minos, the rest are generated automatically from 3rd party sources. There are 3 types of autogenerated repositories:

- upstream project who either don't use git or have a debian/ directory in their master branch.
    - due to limitations in how bzr dailydeb works it's quite problematic to mix repositories who contain a debian/ directory, these recipes mirror upstream projects minus debian/
- backport dependency packages. To keep up with minos changes equally from all LTS releases.
- minos deviation, little changes who are injected automatically to take advantage of upstream (Ubuntu) security updates.

The recipes are run by [minos-sync-bot](https://github.com/minos-sync-bot) and uploaded once every day.
